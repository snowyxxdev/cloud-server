# Cloud Server

This is a Cloud Server in GitHub, this is not intended for public usage.
It's a complete garbage repo if you don't know what this is.

## Information

In order to change the server, you'll need to change the Base64 variable in the Batch file named "amKiP"; the value of the variable needs to be a RAW Url encoded in Base64; Feel free to download the repo but it'll probably not benefit you.
